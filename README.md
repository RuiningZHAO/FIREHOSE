# FIREHOSE

This repository contains IDL routines for reduction of data taken with the Magellan/FIRE infrared spectrograph.  Documentation on their use may be found at the following MIT wiki:

https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/display/FIRE/FIRE+Data+Reduction

This version of the FIREHOSE pipeline supersedes another version currently posted on github under the name firehose_v2.  That version is not supported by the instrument team.  Many of its functions will work, but the current repository posted here contains a number of small fixes uncovered over the years, and will be the version of record going forward.
